PS C:\tmp> npx create-react-app sort-list --template typescript --use-npm
PS C:\tmp\sort-list> npm install json-server
PS C:\tmp\sort-list> npm install styled-components
PS C:\tmp\sort-list> npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-styled-components
PS C:\tmp\sort-list> npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
PS C:\tmp\sort-list> npm install @mui/icons-material @mui/material @emotion/styled @emotion/react

Teach stack:
react | styled component | material ui | material ui icon


How to run the program:
PS C:\tmp\sort-list> npm run db         << this will serve the data.json in http://localhost:4000/results
PS C:\tmp\sort-list> npm run start      << start up dev server in http://localhost:3000/

What Have I done:
- Layout of the card
- Use Material UI Rating component for self and star rating.
- Mobile vs Tablets vs Desktop views
- Keep default sorting as 'high-low' on landing (although I think it should be low to high). And design image doesn't make sense as it's not in sorted order for the hotel list.


TODO:
- Add unit test.
- Add dropdown component.
- Add sorting logic.

If this is a prod production:
- Need another location to storage the images
- Need Loading state while we are waiting for the api.
- Need Error state while the api call failed.
- The 'Sydney' keyword from 'X hotels in Sydney' should come from the api returns
- Would probably persuade designer put all the pricing info (last collumn) in the center in y-axes.
- Create mobile/tablets/desktop util rather than hardcode screen size value
